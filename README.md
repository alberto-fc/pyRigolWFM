# Python RIGOL oscilloscopes waveform library & tools

EDIT

While RIGOL oscilloscopes offer great value for money there seems to be a great lack of tools to read RIGOL oscilloscopes waveform (WFM) files.

Based on the [protocol](http://meteleskublesku.cz/wfm_view/file_wfm.zip) extracted by the [wfm_view](http://meteleskublesku.cz/wfm_view/) project this project implements a feature complete WFM reader library.

The library has been tested with RIGOL DS1052E but should also work with other oscilloscopes.

Additionally a small example application wfmutil.py is included which provides

 - Header extraction 
 - Export to CSV, identical to the internal CSV export of the scope. Just faster.
 - Interactive plotting of the waveform, including a FFT.


## Features

 - Extract all trigger information
 - Support for alternate trigger and different time bases
 - Correct treatment of time and voltage shifts

## Problems
If you run into problems while parsing your waveform, please open an issue.

## Examples

### Information extraction
    % python wfmutil.py info foo.wfm

    Holdoff                  : 5.000e-07 s
    Source                   : CH2
    Slope slope              : 1.040e+06 V/s
    Mode                     : Slope

    Sweep                    : Auto
    Sensitivity              : 3.800e-01 V


### CSV export
    % python wfmutil.py csv foo.wfm | head
    X(CH1),CH1,X(CH2),CH2,
    Second,Volt,Second,Volt,
    -1.04858e-03,-6.03e-01,-1.31072e-02,-3.64e+00,
    -1.04857e-03,-6.03e-01,-1.31071e-02,-3.64e+00,
    -1.04857e-03,-6.03e-01,-1.31071e-02,-3.64e+00,
    -1.04856e-03,-6.03e-01,-1.31070e-02,-3.64e+00,
    -1.04856e-03,-6.03e-01,-1.31070e-02,-3.64e+00,
    -1.04856e-03,-6.03e-01,-1.31069e-02,-3.64e+00,
    -1.04855e-03,-6.03e-01,-1.31069e-02,-3.64e+00,
    -1.04855e-03,-6.03e-01,-1.31068e-02,-3.64e+00,

Note, that this example uses two time bases via alternate trigger. Because of 
this there are two time bases in this CSV export. The exported file is
identical to the files generated by the scope itself.
